# ServerBrowser

## Description
This program enables you to access a list of over 1000 SA-MP Servers, join them, save them as your favourites or search for specific servers.
In addition to that it includes a Version Changer (0.3a - 0.3.7) and a list of past Usernames.

## You want to help?
You can help by [reporting bugs](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/ServerBrowser/issues), [recommending new features](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/ServerBrowser/issues) or [creating pull requests](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/ServerBrowser/pulls).

## Dependencies

As of now, all necessary dependencies are within the repository / retrieved by maven.

## Troubleshooting

If your Client isn't able to connect to the server anymore, the first thing you should do, is to try and download the [latest version of the client](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/ServerBrowser/releases/latest).

The second thing you might want to check, is your firewall. Make sure you haven't blocked port 1099 or the application itself.
